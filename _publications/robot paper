Amidst the global upsurge in industrial robot deployment, there remains a notable gap in our understanding of their environmental impact. This paper explores how the introduction of industrial robots has changed air quality at both the local and neighborhood levels in China. Using the Spatial Durbin Model, we investigate the regional spillovers of PM 2.5 concentration and the diffusion of this innovative technology. Our findings reveal that the rise of robots significantly reduces air pollution in the local area, while exacerbating it in neighboring regions. This contrast is mainly because pollution-intensive industries are more inclined to relocate to neighboring regions than their cleaner counterparts, after the local use of robots increases. Throughout the process, internal costs rather than external costs dominate firmsâ€™ relocation decisions. This study provides novel insights into the complex environmental externalities associated with the spread of industrial robots and highlights the critical issue of growing environmental inequality in the era of emerging technologies.
